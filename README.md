# Zirconia-Gem-Stone-Price-Prediction-

•	Conducted comprehensive EDA on a 27,000-record dataset of cubic zirconia stones, identifying missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies; applied data cleaning and imputation techniques.
•	Engineered features and removed faulty entries (e.g., zero dimensions) to ensure dataset integrity and model accuracy.
•	Encoded categorical variables, managed multicollinearity using Variance Inflation Factor (VIF), and created multiple Linear Regression models using scikit-learn and statsmodels.
•	Achieved an R² score of 93.15% on test data and 93.12% on training data, indicating a strong predictive model fit with minimal overfitting.
•	RMSE on train data 907.132 and RMSE on train data was 911.84.
•	Identified five key predictors for pricing: Carat, Cut, Color, Clarity, and Width (Y); provided actionable insights for business decisions regarding profitability categorization.
